# Branches

* main
  Live branch. The goal of this branch is to reflect what's being served to the Discord server.

* stable
  Stable branch. The goal of this branch is to always be in a state of working. It may not have full functionality, but it shouldn't crash. It'll gather up stuff to be pushed as a group to `main`.

* *feature branches*
  Feature branches are for testing or in-development ideas that are unstable and are not guaranteed to be functional out of the box.
  Each feature branch will eventually be promoted to `stable` and deleted.
